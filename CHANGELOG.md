Running changelog document, will be added to as I commit things.

# 2.1 (`agency.highlysuspect:voldeloom:2.1-SNAPSHOT`)

* **(breaking)** Changed the Gradle extension's name from `minecraft { }` to `volde { }`.
  * Preparation for adding some more free-functions to the extension (it'd be weird if you referred to them with `minecraft`)
  * Possibly preparation for "getting out of the way of other extensions", so you can use it and another Minecraft plugin in the same project? Maybe?
  * Echoes what Loom did - the name is more accurate

(soon, more...)

# 2.0 (`agency.highlysuspect:voldeloom:2.0`)

Initial release of my fork.
