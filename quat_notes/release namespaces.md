* Sample from 1.6.4 (buildcraft-A-1.6.4-4.2.2.jar) contains SRG method and field names
* Sample from 1.5.2 (buildcraft-A-3.7.2.jar) contains SRG method and field names
* Sample from 1.4.7 (buildcraft-A-1.4.7-3.4.4.jar) contains proguarded method and field names

So SRGs are the target distribution namespace in 1.5 and above, and proguard in 1.4 and below
