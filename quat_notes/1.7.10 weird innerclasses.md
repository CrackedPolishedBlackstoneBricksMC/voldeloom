current crash: `java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class aji$4 from class net.minecraft.block.Block`

classes that got dumped to the root of the jar: `aji$4` (hey there it is), `aji$5`, `mr$1`, `mr$2`. `aji` is Block, `mr` is `PlayerManager$PlayerInstance`.

I just kinda noticed this but it's pretty alarming that `innerClasses` in JarScanData is picking up a bunch of stuff under the `null` key :sweat_smile: and you'll never guess what 4 classes exist under the null key..... thats right its my friend aji$5...

## solution

`visitInnerClass` provides `null` for `innerName` for anonymous classes defined inside a method, but for some reason `outerName` is *also* `null` so the `JarScanData` was shoving them under the null key

## takeaway

java collections supporting null keys was a mistake episode 5979085891575124120846187941241595516
